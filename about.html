      <p>Living in Silicon Valley is a daily grind. Competition is intense at school and at the office. We are so caught up getting straight A’s or getting that next promotion, that we often forget how fortunate we are to live here. Silicon Valley is the epicenter of innovation and home to some of the wealthiest people in the world. Yet, there are children in our very own neighborhoods that struggle to eat even one meal a day. This is happening right under our noses.</p>
      <p>“Spark” is a volunteer group of students that wants to help by performing benefit recitals in exchange for donations, 100% of which will benefit a local cause. This year, we are donating food to Belle Haven Elementary School in Menlo Park. Belle Haven’s mission is to educate and provide better opportunities for students of lower income families in the area, but that daunting challenge is made even harder by the fact some of its students can only have one meal a day.</p>

      <p>Your generous donations will be delivered directly to the school. Our initiative may have only a small impact, but we hope it will spark hope and spark others to action. After all, every blaze starts with a spark.</p>
